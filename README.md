Paper-Rock-Scissors Game Console App with Computer Player
This project is a console-based implementation of the classic Paper-Rock-Scissors game in C++. The game allows a human player to play against a computer opponent, making choices between paper, rock, or scissors. The computer player employs a simple strategy based on random selection to compete against the human player.

Features

Player vs. Computer: Play against the computer in a series of Paper-Rock-Scissors rounds.
Simple Strategy: The computer player makes choices randomly between paper, rock, or scissors for each round.
Score Tracking: Keep track of the score for both the human player and the computer player throughout the game.
Console Interface: Interactive console-based interface for game interaction and feedback.

How to Play

Compile: Compile the source code using a C++ compiler such as g++.
Run: Execute the compiled program to start the Paper-Rock-Scissors game.

Game Rules: The game follows the standard rules:
